Description:
Q1. I've created a GitHub account to carry my CTI-110 assignments.
Q2. The repository I created is for my future assignments as it will hold all of my code, files, and file revisions history.
Q3. To clone my repository to my device I open my GitHub desktop and 'clicked' on the 'add' button which shows the option to clone a repository. I created the clone and placed it into my CTI-110 folder as a clone repository and saved.
