Description:
Q1. I've created a GitHub account to carry my CTI-110 assignments.
Q2. The repository I created is for my future assignments as it will hold all of my code, files, and file revisions history.
Q3. To clone my repository to my device I open my GitHub desktop and 'clicked' on the 'add' button which shows the option to clone a repository. I created the clone and placed it into my CTI-110 folder as a clone repository and saved.


# About Me
  ## My Interests

## Websites I Recommend
>[Pinterest](https://pinterest.com) - Pinterest is an important app that I use daily for inspiration and creating mood boards. What I find interesting about the website is that it allows a user to share their post and place it into a board that they've created, while another user could save the first users board as well for inspiration.

>[Notion](https://www.notion.so) - I use Notion to organize my courses, budget, and do to lists. What I find interesting about the website is being able to create charts for budgeting, job applications, work assignments, etc. and place a status on them. An example could be Internship : "**Status**" = **_Applied_** or **_In Process_** or **_Complete_**.
